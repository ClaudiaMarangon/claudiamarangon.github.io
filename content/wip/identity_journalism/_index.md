abstract: "How does the identity of journalists shape news content, and to what extent does it affect readers' behavior? I investigate this question in the context of gender identity and media representation of violence against women (VAW) in Italy, focusing on murders where the victim is a woman. I construct a novel dataset of newspaper articles about murders of women from 2006 to 2022, and I isolate different reporting practices outlined in international guidelines using a dictionary approach. Exploiting the exogenous assignment of journalists to crimes based on work schedules, I find that female authors are more likely to comply with international journalistic guidelines on reporting about VAW. For instance, they are twice as likely as male reporters to mention the Italian helpline number for VAW and around ten percentage points less likely to mention a ``fit of rage'' which, according to the guidelines, tends to minimize the perpetratorâ€™s responsibility in the murder. Moreover, leveraging the exogenous assignment of journalists and the random timing of these murders, I show that increasing exposure to female authors leads to an increase in calls to the helpline number for VAW in the weeks following the murder of a woman in the province where the murder happened."
