 Welcome to my website! I am a Postdoctoral researcher at the Department of Government at Harvard University. I am Research Affiliate at the <a href="https://lawecondata.ethz.ch/"> Group for Law, Economics and Data Science</a> and the <a href="https://pp.ethz.ch/"> Public Policy Group</a> at ETH Zurich.

 I obtained my Ph.D. in Economics at <a href="https://lawecondata.ethz.ch/">ETH Zurich</a> in May 2025 and was Visiting Fellow at the Harvard Kennedy School of Government in 2023. 

 My research lies at the intersection of Media Economics and Economics of Crime, with a focus on the role of gender and racial identity. In particular, I leverage techniques in machine learning and natural language processing to shed light on the effect of identity among professionals, like journalists or judges.

 I also co-organize the <a href="https://econ-ds-seminar.github.io/econ-datascience-seminar/#home">Online Seminar in Economics + Data Science</a>. You can <a href="https://sympa.ethz.ch/sympa/subscribe/econ.data.sci.online.seminar?previous_action=info">join our mailing list</a> to be up to date with our events.
