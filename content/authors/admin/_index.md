 Welcome to my website! I am a PhD Candidate at the <a href="https://lawecondata.ethz.ch/"> Group for Law, Economics and Data Science at ETH Zurich </a>. 

 My research lies at the intersection of Media Economics and Economics of Crime, with a focus on gender and racial identity. In particular, I leverage techniques in machine learning and natural language processing to shed light on the effect of identity among professionals, like journalists or judges.
